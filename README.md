Oh hai there. If you know me, you've probably noticed that I'm often on the road for work or for fun. If you don't know me, well, now you do a little bit.

This is my way of sharing city guides and travel recommendations. Organized by city, each guide contains recommendations for
- Food
- Drinks
- Destinations
- Art
- Lodging
- Memories (sometimes)

Please note that the guides are not meant to be a comprehensive view of the city, but a personal snippet through my lens.
