## Food

### From experience

- ** Wirtshaus Zum Straubinger** (2/3)
	- Looking for Bavarian? This is it! Beer garden with sausage and meat and communal tables. 
	- The portions are HUGE. (2017 Nov) Danqing and I ordered a meat platter to share for two — it could literally feed a family with 4 kids. 
	- I marked it as 2 simply because I’m not a fan of Bavarian food, but it’s definitely worth a visit! 

### My to-try list

- **Brenner Grill** Italian cuisine in an impressively pillared chamber with modern decor -- Michelin guide restaurant. Recommended by Patrick. Ryan and Simon thought the food was good but nothing super special.

## Drinks

### From experience

- ** Ruby Lilly Hotel & Bar** (3/3)
	- This hotel is right by Kelli’s apartment, and serves really decent cocktail by Bavarian standard. The lovely bartender kept popping by to make sure we are okay based on our cocktail consumption — quite entertaining. 
	- Memory from 2017 October: Juan joined us after work and we ended the night at their apartment with schnapps and the kitties. The hangover on day 2 almost murdered me but I somehow made it to Berlin one piece. 

### My to-try list

- **Schumann's** 
	- the main Schumann’s Bar (which transitions from restaurant to drinking hotspot around midnight) is accompanied by the smaller “Camparino” next door, and the intimate “Fleurs du Mal” on the first floor. Arrive early than late -- and always book a table just in case.

## Destinations

### From experience

- **Englischer Garten (English Garden)** (3/3)
	- An absolutely must. This is the place to bring a book, wine in mugs, along with a picnic blanket to just relax and hang out for an afternoon. If you happen to be in Munich in fall (October-ish), the layered colors embellishing the lake is simply superb. 
	- If you are into activities, there are lots of sights to see inside the English Garden — even a Chinese pagoda! 
- **Marienplatz (Mary’s Square)** (3/3)
	- The central square in Munich — very lively and surrounded by shopping areas. Fun to walk around day or night. 

### My to-try list

- **Olympiapark** an Olympic Park which was constructed for the 1972 Summer Olympics; has a modern carillon

## Art & Architecture

### From experience

- **Lenbachhaus (Municipal Gallery in Lebach House)** (3/3)
	- Great collection on European modern art — with a focus on the The Blue Rider (Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Franz Marc, etc.). 
	- The building was the residence of Franz von Lebach. Some of the ornaments are original and quite fun to look at (e.g. door handles). On a sunny day, the natural light dances with the displayed artworks for added effects. Definitely reserve some time to walk around and relax in the courtyard!

### My to-try list

- **Alte Pinakothek** 
- **Munich Residenz** the former royal palace of the Wittelsbach monarchs of Bavaria. The Residenz is the largest city palace in Germany and is open to visitors for its architecture, room decorations, and displays from the former royal collections. 
- **Asam Church**

## Lodging

### From experience

- **Roomers Munich, Autograph Collection**
	- Boutique 
- **Courtyard by Marriott, Munich City** (2/3)
	- Decent business hotel right by the train station and walking distance to the central area. The immediate neighborhood can seem a tad sketchy but commute is super easy.
