## Drinks

### From experience

- **Le Dokhan’s Bar** (2/3)
    - Known for their champagne collection. Tasting was super fun and each champagne was well explained. Important note — it is almost an American/tourist only bar. 
    - 2018 October: I spent an hour being forced to listen to this Houston woman talk non-stop about their political views and first-class flights and how Americans should only pay for American childrens (and not immigrant’s). The cherry on top — she did this over live jazz — not entertained. However, half an hour later, the couple sitting in front of me, carrying stylish Loeffler Randall feather bag, and I had a good time venting and bonding ovet this woman. All in all it was a successful night.
