## Drinks

### From experience

- **Le Dokhan’s Bar** (2/3)
    - Known for their champagne collection. Tasting was super fun and each champagne was well explained. Important note — it is almost an American/tourist only bar. 
    - 2018 October: I spent an hour being forced to listen to this Houston woman talk non-stop about their political views and first-class flights and how Americans should only pay for American childrens (and not immigrant’s). The cherry on top — she did this over live jazz — not entertained. However, half an hour later, the couple sitting in front of me, carrying stylish Loeffler Randall feather bag, and I had a good time venting and bonding ovet this woman. All in all it was a successful night. 
- **Moonshine** (3/3)
    - Amazinf speakeasy through the cooler of a pizzaria with world-class drinks and
friendly staff. I was in love with La Belle Arnaque, and the beautiful bartender Zoe. :) It can get relatively crowded so come early. 
    - 2018 October: Entrusted as a courier, I performed my duty well ;) 

### My to-try list

- **Le Syndicat** Craft cocktail as well, create cocktails using exclusively French ingredients.
- **Little Red Door** Craft cocktail, intimate setting. Must try ‘achievement’, ‘stimulation’ or ‘hedonism’.
- **Candelaria** Agave focused bar -- very international.
- **Bar Hemingway**
