## Food

### From experience
- **Le Bistrot du Gabriel** (3/3)
    - The view and food were both fantastic. Will definitely go again. Best get a reservation if you are looking for good tables during dinner.
    - 2018 October: A starved Sarah went in the first restaurant that didn't have a line. It turns out that they don't have a line because their lunch hour is ending. Perhaps they saw the crazy in my eyes -- they let me in. I enjoyed my fois gras and cod while staring at the couple at the next table -- in my defense, you can see Le Miroir d'eau and Pont de Pierre through the window by them. 
- **La Brasserie Bordelaise** (2/3)
    - This seemed like a popular local spot with amazing food, great wine selection and fun staff. Go for the meat.  
    - 2018 October: As I was traveling alone, I was looking for a restaurant with a populated bar scene when I stumbled upon this place. I had a great conversations with a woman named Lilo that night. She is absolutely crazy, but the fun kind. 

### My to-try list

- **Le Prince Noir** Michelin, spectacular venue with views of Pont d’Aquitaine

## Destinations

### From experience
- **Bordeaux Cathedral** (3/3)
    - It took a long time to build this beautiful cathedral -- 400 years to be exact, and it certainly went through some re-styling during that time as the architecture trend moved from Romanesque to Gothic. I had quite some nerd fun looking for bits of the Romanesque edifice in this mostly Gothic church, and thinking how architectural elements transition from one style to another (e.g. the order of the columns were fun to look at). Even if you are not a hugh fan of architecture, it's a beautiful cathedral to visit. 
- **Le Miroir d'eau** (3/3)
    - To be fair, I never actualy saw the "mirror-like" smoothness for the reflection of Place de la Bourse -- someone was always running on the water when I was visiting. However, I really enjoyed the vibe of the plaza at night, where people are sitting, skateboarding, playing music and riding the Lime scooter around. Great place for hang out after dinner.

### My to-try list

- **Place de la Bourse** 
- **Opéra National de Bordeaux**
- **Jardin Public** 
- **La Cité du Vin** As the name indicates, it's a wine museum with comprehensive wine list.

## Art & Architecture

### From experience

- **CAPC Museum of Contemporary Art of Bordeaux** (3/3)
    - I have a special place in my heart for restored old buildings, so this museum already got 10 points without trying. The architects did a great job in restoration. When you walk through the space, you can see characters of the original building, but framed in a modernized manner with clean lines and immense depth. The rooftop garden/cafe is a great spot to relax and hang out. Their shows are mostly temporary so you'll likely see a different collection of works than I did.
    - 2018 October: Danh Vo's "Take my breath away" was on display there. I actually just saw "Take my breath away" with a different set of works in Guggenheim earlier this year, and to see it here again -- adapted to a site-specific installation showing the work-in-progress of the artist -- was quite interesting. One of the piece truly stood out -- a mirror room with engraved text, a signature medium of Danh Vo. However, when the room is placed in such an open space, a 19th-century warehouse, the effect of the mirror almost folds the architecture into a infinite cubist dream. I was mesmorized.

### My to-try list

- **La Base Sous-Marine** used to be concrete bunker for submarines. now mostly used for art projects, concerts and performances. 
- **Le Garage Moderne** industrial garage, during the day mechanics work on cars here, and during the night it's a vibrant art scene.
- **L’Annexe B** artist studios converted from a high school
- **Darwin Eco-système** cool neighbourhood with collection of art, skate parks, music venues.
