## Food

### From experience
**Le Bistrot du Gabriel**

3/3 :star::star::star:
The view and food were both fantastic. Will definitely go again. Best get a reservation if you are looking for good tables during dinner.
2018 October: A starved Sarah went in the first restaurant that didn't have a line. It turns out that they don't have a line because their lunch hour is ending. Perhaps they saw the crazy in my eyes -- they let me in. I enjoyed my fois gras and cod while staring at the couple at the next table -- in my defense, you can see Le Miroir d'eau and Pont de Pierre through the window by them. 

**La Brasserie Bordelaise**

2/3 :star::star:
This seemed like a popular local spot with amazing food, great wine selection and fun staff. 
2018 October: As I was traveling alone, I was looking for a restaurant with a populated bar scene when I stumbled upon this place. I had a great conversations with a woman named Lilo that night. She is absolutely crazy, but the fun kind.
