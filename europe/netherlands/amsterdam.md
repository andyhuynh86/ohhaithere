## Food

### From experience

- **De Kas** (3/3)
	- Super special meal and venue — De Kas is further away from downtown with a fixed daily menu, farm to table (literally because it’s a vintage greenhouse), vegetable-forward, and simply delicious! Definitely make a reservation and definitely recommend. 
- **Japanese Pancake World** (2/3) 
	- Ryan’s favorite place in Amsterdam! Pretty decent Japanese Okonomiyaki in multiple regional styles. Worth a try if you are craving Asian food. (Apparently gets very packed at night so get a reservation)
- **Hummus bistro d&a** (2/3)
	- Israeli cuisine. Recommend the hummus, falafel, and the Shushka. Great stop for dinner — cute decor inside as well! 
- **Winkel 43** (2/3)
	- I’m not crazy for sweets — but mint tea, Dutch Apple pie with whip cream is exactly what you need sometimes.

### My to-try list

## Drinks

### From experience

- **Pulitzer’s Bar** (3/3)
	- LOVED IT! Literary themed, art deco decor, situated in the beautiful Pulitzer Hotel (definitely walk around the glass corridors). The seasonal menu was featuring Ernest Hemingway drinks. Also a great bar for drinking solo! 
- **Tunes Bar** (3/3)
	- Delicious cocktails with season menu — slick, modern decor. Based on my track record, of course this is another hotel bar -- at Conservatorium.
	- This is not the best fit for hanging out at the bar by yourself — it’s more of a drinks with your friends after work place (as the bar is swamped with men in suits by 6:30pm on a Wednesday). A little too busy for my taste but also proves its popularity. 
	- Their Gin and tonic with cucumber actually features a full stripe of cucumber instead of a slice. I was impressed. 
- **Tales and Spirits** (2/3)
	- Beautiful bar, packed with antiques, vintage posters, good drinks and personable staff. 
	- **To try:** Roald Dahl-inspired Gobblefunk; numbering 11 iterations on the Old Fashioned section; The Nutcracker
- **Cafe Gollem Raamsteeg** (2/3)
	- ALL ABOUT DAT BEER! Neighborhood friendly little pub with kick ass selection for beer. Down to earth, no bullshit, dive-y and cramped— if it wasn’t so hot inside, it’s a perfect post dinner hangout. 

### My to-try list

- **Door 74** speakeasy, cocktail
- **Vesper Bar** cocktail, named after James Bond’s drink of choice, Vesper Martini
- **Porem** speakeasy, top tier cocktail with sushi - to try: Sergio Ramos Gin Fizz (looks like it’s closed on Google maps)

- **Bar Oldenhof** speakeasy, notoriously hard to find, Hemingway-esque interior, 
- **Twenty Third Bar** on the 23rd floor of Hotel Okura and offers guests panoramic views across central and southern Amsterdam; their hors-d’oeuvres are prepared at the Michelin-starred restaurant called Ciel Bleu
- **Hiding in Plain Sight** cocktail, good ambiance; sometimes have live music events! 
- **Celcius and C Bar** fresh approach to cocktails and contemporary settings
- **Kevin Bacon Bar** unpretentious, eccentric, Thai food influenced; Hotel not hotel

## Art & Architecture

### From experience

- **Van Gogh Museum** (3/3)
	- An absolute must for me. The museum arranged Van Gogh’s works primarily chronologically — shows his artistic development in theme, skills and influence. You can truly walked his path through his works in this museum. 
	- You’d be disappointed if you are looking for his more well known works — there are a few, but not a ton. However, for art nerds like me, you can clearly see how he builds up his repertoires to works like the Starry Night. 
	- My favorite painting from Van Gogh is the Irises — which resides on the top floor. 
- **Moco Museum** (2/3)
	- Small museum focuses on contemporary art and has a small collection of modern art. When I visited, the museum was featuring exhibitions on Banksy and Icy & Sot. Both are very expressive politically using modern medium — strong references to pop art.
	- The Lichtenstein room is worth a visit — it’s a reproduction of Van Gogh’s bedroom, of course, in Lichtenstein style. Considering the proximity of this piece to the Van Gogh Museum — quite an intriguing hat tilt. 

### My to-try list

- **Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam** modern art
- **Rijksmuseum** 
- **Rembrandt House Museum**
