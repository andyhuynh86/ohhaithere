- **Kronenhalle** A Zurich must
- **Widder Bar** one of the best whiskey selections in the country and some of the world’s most talented jazz artists
- **The Old Crow** friendly backstreet bar, rare spirits
- **OOO** The closest thing Zurich has to a secret bar, this impressive rooftop bar on the Bahnhofstrasse can be found by entering the discreet door to the right of the Modissa clothes store (during the day, you enter by walking through the shop). Take the lift up to the top floor and enjoy amazing award-winning cocktails, and an atmospheric view of the local skyline and busy street below.
