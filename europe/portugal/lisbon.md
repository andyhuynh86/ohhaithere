## Food

### From experience

**A Casa do Bacalhau**

1/3

"The cod house" seems to be a local favorite. The staff was fantastic; wine list impressive; and the ambiance and decor just can’t be beat. One tiny problem — the food was way too salty for my taste. It is more traditional Portughese style, which tend to be heavier on the salt. If you are good with saltier food, this place is 10/10.

## Drinks

### From experience

**Red Frog Speakeasy**

3/3 

My type of place — slightly hidden but easy to locate, good service without being snobby, great showsmanship in mixology, and equipped with a smoking area in the back (mostly for cigar smokers). The space is intimate and seems fit best for small groups or single travelers. It’s a bar I’d revisit for sure.

2018 October: I decided to take my nightcap here, and went with an “American ganster” (twist of old fashioned) It is slightly sweeter than my taste but good cocktail overall. However, the second drink I had, “too famous to be caught naked”, was just phenomenal and a total gustatory journey. Definitely recommend.

**Pensão Amor**

2/3

This bar used to be a brothel, and they are not shy to show that with paintings, graffitis, sculptures... essentially every imaginable way. It is located above Lisbon’s Pink Street and populated with tourists. (Yes all you hear is English) The drinks are quite decent, and definitely worth a stop to impress out-of-towners.

### My to-try list

**Pavilhão Chinês**
great decorations

**Maria Caxuxua**
known for caipirinhas

**Bar A Parodia**
old fashioned bar, great cocktail
