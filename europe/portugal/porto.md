## Food

### From experience

- **Tapabento S.Bento** 
    - First thing first, don't dream of walking in, just make a reservation. They are fully booked. 
- **Marisqueira do Porto** (3/3)
    - SEAFOOD ALL DAY EVERYDAY. This place is further away from the city center so not too crowded with tourists. Great place for dining alone and walking in as they have a long bar. I loved their seafood rice and grilled seafood platter. The staff is very attentive and friendly -- easy to do off-the-menu adjustments. Love this place and will certainly come back!

## Drinks

### From experience

- **Candelabro** (3/3)
    - Local hangout spot where everyone knows each other. Don't order a cocktail, this is a beer/wine/whiskey straight kind of place. (I tried to order and old fashioned and I got a 'huh' look from the bartender :P)
    - 2018 October: I had a drink with a new friend Ricardo here. Everyone knows each other and people would just jump out of cars to come join for a drink or a hug. Fantastic night in Porto.

### My to-try list

- **Aduela taberna/bar** also a local's bar but more hip than Candelabro

## Destinations

### From experience

- **Parque das Virtudes** (3/3)
    - Come with a beer, you'd need it for the view and for the climb when you are walking to this place. This place has one of the best views to see the sunset over Duoro River. This is quite the hangout spot so can get a bit crowded. Don't leave right after sunset.
- **São Bento station** (1/3)
    - You should come, but just do a quick walkby. The train station fully decorated in blue tiles is quite beautiful, but there's really not much else to it.

## Lodging

### From experience

- **Airbnb** [Explore a Cidade e Contemple o Rio à Janela](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/plus/25185120) (3/3)
    - Strongly recommend. The host is amazing, the location is amazing, the view can not be beat. This will certainly be my go-to spot if I come back to Porto. Tiny problem  -- make sure you pack light or you can carry your suitcase up the second floor, as elevator is the only thing not available for this apartment.
