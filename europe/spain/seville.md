## Food

### From experience
**La Bodega Del Alfalfa**

3/3

Recommended by my Airbnb host, La Bodega is a traditional tapas spot. It’s certainly a local’s choice and my best dining experience in Seville.

2018 October: Traveling alone is tough when it comes to eating. This place was friendly and chill and relaxed when it comes to single guests. Sure, I didn’t technically get a table, or a seat, alright I ate standing by the bar. But you would be touched by the passion from the waiters who arranged my whole meal, and not so touched by the touchiness of your neighbouring standing eater who’s apparently a traveling millionaire dentist (insert eye roll). Regardless, I was well-fed and entertained.

### My to-try list

**T de Triana**

Located right by the river and you can sit by the bank. 

**La Brunilda Tapas**

### From Experience
**Le XIX**

1/3

This is definitely one of the fancier places with nice Scotch and costumed bartenders. Men were in suits and women in gowns. 

2018 October: However, don’t be fooled by the fancy bar display — this is also where I had one of the worst old fashioned in human history. Yes human history. The bartender didn’t know the recipe. I don’t speak Spanish, but mixology is a language without borders so I knew he had no idea what he was doing. I’d still come back because my Oban 14 was $10 and the red couches were very comfortable. Just steer away from the cocktails.

**The Second Room**

3/3 

Very foreigner friendly spot with decent drinks. Warnings ahead, this place can get very crowded on weekend nights because of its internet fame. The bartenders were very welcoming and rememebered me upon my second visit. 

2018 October: The first time when I visited, I met two fantastic older Dutch couples who visit a different European city every weekend, roll their own cigarettes and know motorcycle like no one else. The second time, three former Irish soldiers and a Spanish sculptor who spent half an hour telling me to be true to my heart. Fun place to meet fun people. 

**La Tertulia**

2/3 

Relaxing spot by the river. It’s located on Calle Betis, where you’d want to be on a Friday or Satuday night for Flamenco clubs. However, on a Sunday night, it’s rather relaxing with locals only.

2018 October: The owner poured me a glass a gin and gave me my own bottle of tonic water. I carried this DIY-styled drink to the river and ended up finishing all the gin and some of the tonic. End of story. 

### My to-try list

**Casa Anselma***

Near Calle Betis and opens at midnight. Apparently one of *the* flamenco clubs to be at.

I’d give this place a million points if I could.

**Muelle Camaronero**

2/3

To be totally honest, I have no idea what this place is. I stumbled upon this little area where you can walk down to the water during my late night strolls. I bookmarked it as a great spot to sit and hangout with friends by the water.
