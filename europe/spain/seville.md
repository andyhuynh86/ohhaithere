**Le XIX**

2/3

This is definitely one of the fancier places with nice Scotch and costumed bartenders. Men were in suits and women in gowns. 

2018 October: However, don’t be fooled by the fancy bar display — this is also where I had one of the worst old fashioned in human history. Yes human history. The bartender didn’t know the recipe at all. I don’t speak Spanish, but mixology is a language without borders so I knew he had no idea what he was doing. 

I’d still come back because my Oban 14 was $10 and the red couches were very comfortable.

**The Second Room**

2/3 

Very foreigner friendly spot with decent drinks. Warning ahead, this place can get very crowded on weekend nights because of its internet fame. 

2018 October: However, when I visited, I met two fantastic older Dutch couples who roll their own cigarettes and know motorcycle like no one else, so I’d take my chances.

**La Tertulia**

1/3 

Relaxing place by the river. It’s located on Calle Betis, where you want to be on a Friday or Satuday night for Flamenco clubs. However, on a Sunday night, it’s rather relaxing with locals.

2018 October: The owner poured me a glass a gin and gave me my own bottle of tonic water — and I carried this DIY styled drink to the river. I ended up finishing all the gin and some of the tonic. End of story.
