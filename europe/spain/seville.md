**Le XIX**
2/3
Definitely one of the fancier places with scotch and costumed bartenders. Men were in suits and women in gowns. However, don’t be fooled by the fancy bar display — this is also where I had one of the worst old fashioned in human history. Yes human history. The bartender didn’t know the recipe at all. I don’s speak Spanish, but mixology is a language without borders so I knew he had no idea what he was doing. 
I’ll still come back because my Oban 14 was $10 and the red couches are very comfortable.

**The Second Room**
2/3 
Very foreigner friendly spot with decent drinks. Warning ahead, this place can get very crowded on weekend nights because of its internet fame. However, when I visited, I met two fantastic older Dutch couples who roll their own cigarettes and know motorcycle like no one else. 

**La Tertulia**
2/3 
Relaxing place by the river. It’s located on Calle Betis, where you want to be on a Friday or Satuday night for Flamenco club. However, on a Sunday night, it’s rather relaxing. 
2018 October: The owner poured me a glass a gin and gave me my own bottle of tonic water — and I carried this DIY styled drink to the river. I ended up finishing all the gin and some of the tonic. End of story.
