## Drinks

### From experience

- **(Napa) Darioush** (3/3)
    - Reservation recommended as space is limited
- **(Oakville) Opus One Winery** (3/3) Bordeaux-style Cabernet Sauvignon blend
- **(Rutherford) Inglenook** (3/3)
    - dates back to 1879, one of the original Napa wineries, the elegant, ivy-covered Inglenook. Tours are by appointment only and are definitely worthwhile so to appreciate the amazing historic grounds.
- **(Calistoga) Pride Mountain Vineyards** (3/3)
- **(Calistoga) Castello di Amorosa** (3/3)
    - The wine was not super memorable for me, but the Tuscan castle left an impression for sure -- not something you expect to see in California at all. There are certain areas that's only open as part of the guided tour (e.g. the torture chamber).
    -  drawbridge, high stone walls, gargoyles, a church, and a fully equipped torture chamber

### My to-try list

- **(Napa) Artesa Vineyards & Winery** the very best in terms of Napa scenery. The family-owned winery is set upon the highest hill of the 350-acre estate. A terrace offers beautifully expansive vistas of the surrounding countryside, and on clear days, a view of the San Francisco skyline.
- **(Napa) Silverado Vineyards** hilltop estate overlooping the valley, stunning tasting room, private Saddleblock Vineyard Tour
- **(Napa) Domaine Carneros** stunning, fairy-tale estate was modeled after an 18th-century French mansion owned by Taittinger. three terraces from which you can enjoy breathtaking views while sipping extraordinary sparkling and Pinot Noir wines. reservation required
- **(Napa) Stagâ€™s Leap Wine Cellars** historic winery with caves and that is famous for estate-grown cabernet sauvignons, culinary tours available
- **(Rutherford) Rutherford Hill Winery** wine cave, known for merlot
- **(St Helena) V. Sattui Winery** most popular and most visited winery, old-world Italian charm, more than 60 different wines, consistently achieves top awards for wines crafted by winemaker Brooks Painter, family, dog friendly winery. Same owner built Castello di Amorosa.
