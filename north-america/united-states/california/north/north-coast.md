# North Coast

I'm totally stealing this description from Wiki: "The North Coast of California is the region in Northern California that lies on the Pacific coast between San Francisco Bay and the Oregon border. It commonly includes Mendocino, Humboldt, and Del Norte counties."

I've taken multiple trips up the North Coast and even a city girl like me has always enjoyed my time up in this part of California.
