## Food

### From experience

- **(Monterey) Schooners Coastal Kitchen & Bar** (2/3)
	- To be honest, I have no memory of the food here. However, the view is truly fantastic -- I visited with my family and we relaxed on the outdoor patio watching kayakers and defending our food from the seagulls. There's also a small plaza next to the restaurant and it's quite nice to walk around. 
- **(Monterey) First Awakenings** (1/3)
	- This is supposedly one of the best brunch spots in Monterey. I had a sandwich (beef encounter) for takeout that was meh-okay, but I think if we had a sit-down experience it'd probably more enjoyable.
- **(Monterey-Carmel) Roy's Restaurant** (2/3)
	- This is the restaurant at the Inn at Spanish Bay on 17-mile drive. The food is mediocre but you get to watch the golfers and hang out on the lawn. The walks around the hotel and the firepits at night are lovely. Apparently a bagpiper plays at sunset everyday but I've never seen them.  
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) Flying Fish Grill** (3/3)
	- Charming restaurant with contemporary Asian cuisine. I'm a big fan of the black bean halibut and the owners -- a great couple from Japan and Canton. We had a fun mini jamming session with the husband at the entrance waiting for tables during one of the visits.
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) Mission Ranch Restaurant** (2/3)
	- This restaurant has such an amazing view. The food is mediocre (American ALL THE WAY) but you won't mind at all. I absolutely love the sunset here. The restaurant has a no-reservation rule, but you can pop in as early as opening to grab a table for sunset. While you wait, you can always get a drink and walk/relax in the lawn next to the restaurant. 
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) L'Escargot** (2/3)
	- One of my family's favorite French restaurants in California -- the escargot is indeed quite good. Classic French cooking with a nice wine list. 
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) Casanova** (3/3)
	- French-Italian cuisine, very charming set up. I love the interior. This is one of my go-tos for Carmel. 
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) Dametra Cafe** (1/3)
	- Lots of hype and very high yelp reviews so I feel like I should put it up here. I've been here multiple times but I can't seem to fall in love it. I do enjoy the Lamb Shank and the music performance if you want to give it a try.
- **(Carmel Valley) Lucia Restaurant & Bar** (3/3)
	- The restaurant at Bernardus is quite good. The chef's table is great to spot to sit at -- there are notes from celebrity on the wall.
- **(Big Sur) Sierra Mar** (3/3)
	- HIGHLY RECOMMEND. This is one of those fine dining restaurants that's worth saving up money and visiting at least once in your life for. Located on a cliff by the Pacific in Big Sur, this restaurant has an UNBEATABLE VIEW. Fine dining with a tasting menu, the food can be a hit or miss. I've personally always enjoyed the food but some of my friends were not too crazy about it. Most likely need a reservation -- they sometimes take in people for late lunch.

### My to-try list

- **(Monterey) Jacks Monterey** The restaurant in Portola Hotel and Spa. The decor and the tree in the space makes it quite magical. 
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) Akaoni** Amazing collection of seafood (sushi, sashimi...) with sake, be prepared for minimal service but the food is worth it.
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) Aubergine** Fine dining with tasting menu. 
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) La Balena** Ambience of a Florence trattoria; must try the whole fish
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) Il Grillo** Italian (pasta forward), sister restaurant of La Balena
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) Il Tegamino** Italian comfort food
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) La Bicyclette** Classic French brasserie vibe; casual, village-theme, comfort food. 
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) Cultura** contemporary Oaxaca-inspired restaurant with a hand-picked selection of mezcals
- **(Carmel Valley) Roux** Casual, best for lunch/brunch. Try the beignets.

## Drinks

### From experience

- **(Carmel Valley) Folktale Winery & Vineyards** (3/3)
	- My favorite winery in Carmel Valley! Never had a bad day here with the sparkling rose and the charcuterie board. Also great place for a photoshoot! 

### My to-try list

- **(Monterey) Hahn Estates** Truthfully, I have no idea if the wine is actually good. But apparently the estate overlooks Salinas Valley and you can do ATV rides.

## Destinations

### From experience
- **(Pacific Grove) Monarch Butterfly Sanctuary** (1/3)
	- Only available from November till February — the Monarch butterfly stops by the eucalyptus grove in Pacific Grove. It’s a pretty small space and the butterflies are quite hard to spot in clusters without equipment (in my opinion). We got quite lucky and saw a few butterflies that are resting on lower grounds.
- **(Monterey) Monterey Bay Aquarium** (3/3)
	- I mean...I'm usually not big into zoos or aquariums, but this is the one to go to. I can literally spend half an hour in front of the sea otter tank. THEY ARE SO CUTE. The feeding session in the kelp forest is fun to watch, and the outdoor patio is a nice hangout -- definitely zoom in on the red buoy to watch the seals chilling on it! Apparently you can also sign up to feed them yourselves!
- **(Monterey-Carmel) 17-mile drive** (1/3)
	- SO CROWDED. JUST. SO. CROWDED. The drive and the houses are indeed beautiful. If you are into golfing this seems like the perfect spot -- but the crowd! But if you do go, take a stop at the Inn at Spanish Bay -- it's nice to walk around and watch the golfers. 
- **(Carmel) Point Lobos State Natural Reserve** (3/3)
	- One of my favorite thing to do in Carmel is to take a hike at Point Lobos. Nature at its finest. Definitely stop by China Cove for seal watching!
- **(Carmel) Monastery Beach** (3/3)
	- My favorite beach in Carmel -- more of a local spot. You won't get the fine white sand at Carmel beach but also not the crowd.  
- **(Big Sur) Bixby Bridge** (3/3)
	- By now you've probably figured out that I'm not a fan of the crowd. HOWEVER, Bixby Bridge is worth the crowd 100%. It could be hard to find parking so start looking early. 
- **(Big Sur) Henry Miller Memorial Library** (1/3)
	- It's really a bookstore and a coffee shop in the woods, but worth a pit stop. Sometimes they have fun creative events so definitely check out the calendar.

### My to-try list

- **(Pacific Grove) Asilomar Hotel and Conference Grounds** The walks on the ground is perfect for catching sunsets
- **(Big Sur) Pfeiffer Beach**
	- Locals favorite beach "It's hard to beat the iconic coastal scenery, sea spray and lavender-tinted sand at Pfeiffer Beach in Big Sur. There's no sign on scenic Highway 1 that marks the entry, but coming from the north it's easy to spot the turnoff, just past the entrance to Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park. The sharp right turn onto Sycamore Canyon could be what makes this treasured beach such a well kept secret!"
- **(Big Sur) Esalen Hot Spring - Public Night Bathing** 
	- Esalen is a spa and a retreat center, very expensive one that costs a log and an arm. However, they do open for hot tub by the cliffside -- only during 1-3am, and you would need to reserve in the morning to join for the same night. Only about 20+ people are allowed in each day, and usually part of the group bath naked, but totally up to your choice. Heard it's an amazing experience and I've wanted to go.
- **(Big Sur) Point Sur Lighthouse** guided tour only, and the view is supposed to be windy and amazing. 
- **(Big Sur) New Camaldoli Hermitage** it's an hermitage for Benedictine monks, and visitors are welcomed to walk on the ground during the day.

## Art & Architecture

### From experience

- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) Carmel Mission Basilica Museum** (2/3)
	- Nothing crazy impressive but the mission has charming building and garden, quiet time away from the crowd on ocean avenue, and some insight into the history of California.

### My to-try list

- **(Monterey) Monterey Museum of Art** small museumfeaturing local artists 
- **(Big Sur) Coast Gallery and Cafe** Art and coffee by Highway 1!

## Lodging

### From experience

- **(Carmel Valley) Bernardus Lodge & Spa** (3/3)
	- One of my favorite spot in the area -- I've always had a great time here. Bernardus is also a winery down the road -- so the tasting on the hotel ground is quite lovely. Love the restaurant, the spa, and the infinity hot tub. It's a perfect place to relax for a weekend trip.   
- **[(Carmel Valley) Rose Garden Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/20093481)** (3/3)
	- Such a charming little place! It's the definition of a quaint country cottage. Trust me, the Airbnb photos does not do it justice. The host let us pick fresh vegetables from the garden for breakfast -- and I literally had the best tomato I've ever had in my life. Would go back in a heartbeat. 

### My to-try list

- **(Monterey) Portola Hotel & Spa**
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) L'Auberge**
