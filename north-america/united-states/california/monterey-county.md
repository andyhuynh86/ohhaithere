## Food

### From experience

- **(Monterey) Schooners Coastal Kitchen & Bar** (2/3)
	- To be honest, I have no memory of the food here. However, the view is truly fantastic -- I visited with my family and we relaxed on the outdoor patio watching kayakers and defending our food from the seagulls. There's also a small plaza next to the restaurant and it's quite nice to walk around. 
- **(Monterey) First Awakenings** (1/3)
	- This is supposedly one of the best brunch spots in Monterey. I had a sandwich (beef encounter) for takeout that was meh-okay, but I think if we had a sit-down experience it'd probably more enjoyable.
- **(Monterey-Carmel) Roy's Restaurant** (2/3)
	- This is the restaurant at the Inn at Spanish Bay on 17-mile drive. The food is mediocre but you get to watch the golfers and hang out on the lawn. The walks around the hotel and the firepits at night are lovely. Apparently a bagpiper plays at sunset everyday but I've never seen them.  
- **(Carmel-by-thesea) Il Tegamino** (3/3)
    - OMG IT'S SO GOOD. That's pretty much all I have to say about this place. If you like pasta, if you like Italian, if you like comfort food. This is the place you want to be at. It's pretty tiny so make sure to make a reservation!
    - Recommend: Polpette Trio, Paccheri al Ragú Napoletano, 
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) La Bicyclette** (3/3)
	- Classic French brasserie vibe with casual, down-to-earth, comfort food. I really love their Champignon pizza (with truffle oil). I have only come here for lunch but I've heard great things about dinner as well.
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) Flying Fish Grill** (3/3)
	- Charming restaurant with contemporary Asian cuisine. I'm a big fan of the black bean halibut and the owners -- a great couple from Japan and Canton. We had a fun mini jamming session with the husband at the entrance waiting for tables during one of the visits.
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) Casanova** (3/3)
	- French-Italian cuisine, very charming set up. I love the interior. This is one of my go-tos for Carmel. 
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) Mission Ranch Restaurant** (2/3)
	- This restaurant has such an amazing view. The food is mediocre (American ALL THE WAY) but you won't mind at all. I absolutely love the sunset here. The restaurant has a no-reservation rule, but you can pop in as early as opening to grab a table for sunset. While you wait, you can always get a drink and walk/relax in the lawn next to the restaurant. 
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) L'Escargot** (2/3)
	- One of my family's favorite French restaurants in California -- the escargot is indeed quite good. Classic French cooking with a nice wine list. 
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) Dametra Cafe** (1/3)
	- Lots of hype and very high yelp reviews so I feel like I should put it up here. I've been here multiple times but I can't seem to fall in love it. I do enjoy the Lamb Shank and the music performance if you want to give it a try.
- **(Carmel Valley) Lucia Restaurant & Bar** (3/3)
	- The restaurant at Bernardus is quite good. The chef's table is great to spot to sit at -- there are notes from celebrity on the wall.
- **(Big Sur) Sierra Mar** (3/3)
	- HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS. This is one of those fine dining restaurants that's worth saving up money and visiting at least once in your life for. Located on a cliff by the Pacific in Big Sur, this restaurant has an UNBEATABLE VIEW. Fine dining with a tasting menu, the food can be a hit or miss. I've personally enjoyed the food but some of my friends were not too crazy about it. Most likely need a reservation -- they sometimes take in people for late lunch.
- **(Big Sur) The Sur House** (3/3)
    - DELICIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL. If you are spending the night near Big Sur, this is the perfect spot for brunch. The view out on the patio is spectacular. Drinking coffee while overlooking the trees and the ocean is such a special experience. Personally, I think the food is much better than Sierra Mar, but the architecture and experience provided by Sierra Mar is hard to beat. 

### My to-try list

- **(Monterey) Jacks Monterey** The restaurant in Portola Hotel and Spa. The decor and the tree in the space makes it quite magical. 
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) Akaoni** Amazing collection of seafood (sushi, sashimi...) with sake, be prepared for minimal service but the food is worth it.
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) Aubergine** Fine dining with tasting menu. 
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) La Balena** Ambience of a Florence trattoria; must try the whole fish
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) Forge in the Forest** Dog-friendly mainstay for American fare with heated patio seating, fire pits & lush gardens.
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) Il Grillo** Italian (pasta forward), sister restaurant of La Balena
- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) Cultura** contemporary Oaxaca-inspired restaurant with a hand-picked selection of mezcals
- **(Carmel Valley) Roux** Casual, best for lunch/brunch. Try the beignets. 
- **(Big Sur) Nepenthe** More casual spot in Big Sur. Eatery perched on a Big Sur cliffside offering California fare & a terrace with breathtaking views.

## Drinks

### From experience

- **(Carmel Valley) Folktale Winery & Vineyards** (3/3)
	- My favorite winery in Carmel Valley! Never had a bad day here with the sparkling rose and the charcuterie board. Also great place for a photoshoot! 

### My to-try list

- **(Monterey) Hahn Estates** Truthfully, I have no idea if the wine is actually good. But apparently the estate overlooks Salinas Valley and you can do ATV rides.

## Destinations

### From experience
- **(Pacific Grove) Monarch Butterfly Sanctuary** (1/3)
	- Only available from November till February — the Monarch butterfly stops by the eucalyptus grove in Pacific Grove. It’s a pretty small space and the butterflies are quite hard to spot in clusters without equipment (in my opinion). We got quite lucky and saw a few butterflies that are resting on lower grounds.
- **(Monterey) Monterey Bay Aquarium** (3/3)
	- I mean...I'm usually not big into zoos or aquariums, but this is the one to go to. I can literally spend half an hour in front of the sea otter tank. THEY ARE SO CUTE. The feeding session in the kelp forest is fun to watch, and the outdoor patio is a nice hangout -- definitely zoom in on the red buoy to watch the seals chilling on it! Apparently you can also sign up to feed them yourselves!
- **(Monterey-Carmel) 17-mile drive** (1/3)
	- SO CROWDED. JUST. SO. CROWDED. The drive and the houses are indeed beautiful. If you are into golfing this seems like the perfect spot -- but the crowd! But if you do go, take a stop at the Inn at Spanish Bay -- it's nice to walk around and watch the golfers. 
- **(Carmel) Point Lobos State Natural Reserve** (3/3)
	- One of my favorite thing to do in Carmel is to take a hike at Point Lobos. Nature at its finest. Definitely stop by China Cove for seal watching!
- **(Carmel) Monastery Beach** (3/3)
	- My favorite beach in Carmel -- more of a local spot. You won't get the fine white sand at Carmel beach but also not the crowd.  
- **(Big Sur) Bixby Bridge** (3/3)
	- By now you've probably figured out that I'm not a fan of the crowd. HOWEVER, Bixby Bridge is worth the crowd 100%. It could be hard to find parking so start looking early. 
- **(Big Sur) Henry Miller Memorial Library** (1/3)
	- It's really a bookstore and a coffee shop in the woods, but worth a pit stop. Sometimes they have fun creative events so definitely check out the calendar.

### My to-try list

- **(Pacific Grove) Asilomar Hotel and Conference Grounds** The walks on the ground is perfect for catching sunsets
- **(Big Sur) Pfeiffer Beach**
	- Locals favorite beach "It's hard to beat the iconic coastal scenery, sea spray and lavender-tinted sand at Pfeiffer Beach in Big Sur. There's no sign on scenic Highway 1 that marks the entry, but coming from the north it's easy to spot the turnoff, just past the entrance to Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park. The sharp right turn onto Sycamore Canyon could be what makes this treasured beach such a well kept secret!"
- **(Big Sur) Esalen Hot Spring - Public Night Bathing** 
	- Esalen is a spa and a retreat center, very expensive one that costs a log and an arm. However, they do open for hot tub by the cliffside -- only during 1-3am, and you would need to reserve in the morning to join for the same night. Only about 20+ people are allowed in each day, and usually part of the group bath naked, but totally up to your choice. Heard it's an amazing experience and I've wanted to go.
- **(Big Sur) Point Sur Lighthouse** guided tour only, and the view is supposed to be windy and amazing. So we stopped by -- it's a lengthy tour (around 3 hrs), only offered certain days of the week, and you need to be there early because admittance is limited. I'd like to try next time.
- **(Big Sur) New Camaldoli Hermitage** it's an hermitage for Benedictine monks, and visitors are welcomed to walk on the ground during the day.

## Art & Architecture

### From experience

- **(Carmel-by-the-sea) Carmel Mission Basilica Museum** (2/3)
	- Nothing crazy impressive but the mission has charming building and garden, quiet time away from the crowd on ocean avenue, and some insight into the history of California.
- **(Big Sur) Ventana’s Glass House Gallery** (3/3)
	- This address doesn't actually exist on Google map so just put in the Sur House instead. This gallery is located right next to the restaurant. It's a very petite spot with beautiful architecture, amazing view, and some good shopping for art and Ventana merch. If you are passing by -- it's a good pit stop. By the way, you don't need to stay at Ventana to come here.

### My to-try list

- **(Monterey) Monterey Museum of Art** small museum featuring local artists 
- **(Big Sur) Coast Gallery and Cafe** Art and coffee by Highway 1! (It's at a tricky turn spot)
- **(Big Sur) Hawthorne Gallery** Art gallery

## Lodging

### From experience

- **(Carmel Valley) Bernardus Lodge & Spa** (3/3)
	- One of my favorite spot in the area -- I've always had a great time here. Bernardus is also a winery down the road -- so the tasting on the hotel ground is quite lovely. Love the restaurant, the spa, and the infinity hot tub. It's a perfect place to relax for a weekend trip.   
- **[(Carmel Valley) Rose Garden Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/20093481)** (3/3)
	- Such a charming little place! It's the definition of a quaint country cottage. Trust me, the Airbnb photos does not do it justice. The host let us pick fresh vegetables from the garden for breakfast -- and I literally had the best tomato I've ever had in my life. Would go back in a heartbeat.
- **(Big Sur) Ventana** (2/3)
	- The resort is beautiful with fantastic views and events. The ground itself is in the redwoods (so you are not right on the shore), but you can still see the ocean beyond the woods. It has two hot tubs and two pools -- I only got to visit the main one, but I heard the Japanese pool is also amazing. My personal experience with them has been slightly disappointing for the amount of money we paid, so I'm giving it a 2/3, but I'm definitely down to give it another try.
	- There's also a glamping site at Ventana that I want to try. :)
